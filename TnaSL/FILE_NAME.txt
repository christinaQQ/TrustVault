The argument provided to '-tm' must be an algorithm already implemented
within the system. Currently, the following algorithms are implemented:

> 'eigen': The EigenTrust algorithm of Hector Garcia-Molina, et al.
> 'peertrust': PeerTrust from Georgia Tech.
> 'm2mtrust': M2MTrust from Georgia Tech.
> 'm2mtrust_up': M2MTrust with uniform propagation.
> 'tnasl": System using Subjective Logic operators, inspired by Josang et al.
> 'none':  Absence of trust management. Essentially random source selection.

Similarly, the possible arguments to '-strategy' are pre-programmed:

> 'isolated'
> 'collective 
> 'disguise'
> 'spy'
as described in the papers EigenTrust and M2MTrust.
